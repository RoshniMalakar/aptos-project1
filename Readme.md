# Time Tracking Smart Contract

## Vision

The Time Tracking project aims to create a decentralized platform for freelancers and clients to manage work hours and payments seamlessly. By using blockchain technology, this platform provides a transparent and tamper-proof way for freelancers to log their work hours and for clients to make payments based on those hours. This solution ensures trust and eliminates disputes over logged work hours, creating a fair and efficient work environment.

## Features

- **Log Work Hours**: Freelancers can log their work hours, specify their hourly rate, and store this information on the blockchain.
- **Pay for Work Hours**: Clients can verify the logged hours and make payments to freelancers, ensuring that the payment process is transparent and accurate.
- **Immutable Records**: Work logs are stored on-chain, providing an immutable and reliable record of work performed and payments made.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Devnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x920bef296cab7ffc8ec07f7b6da54d5ce97821f6b227841426dee6f1b1c26c55`

## How It Works

1. **Log Work**:
   - Freelancers call the `log_work` function to log the number of hours worked.
   - The function requires the number of hours worked and the hourly rate as parameters and creates a `WorkLog` stored on the blockchain.
2. **Pay Worker**:
   - Clients call the `pay_worker` function to pay a freelancer for logged hours.
   - The contract checks if the hours have not already been paid and calculates the total payment based on the logged hours and hourly rate.
   - The payment process will be implemented in future iterations.

## Future Scope

- **On-Chain Payment Handling**: Add functionality to automatically transfer payment from clients to freelancers using Aptos tokens.
- **Approval Mechanism**: Implement an approval system where clients can approve logged hours before payment is processed, ensuring both parties agree on the work performed.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Develop a dispute resolution feature to handle conflicts between freelancers and clients over work hours or payment.
- **Milestone-Based Payments**: Allow milestone-based payment options where larger projects can be broken down into smaller milestones for easier tracking and payment.
- **Automated Invoices**: Create automated invoices based on logged work hours to simplify billing and documentation for both freelancers and clients.
- **Rating and Feedback System**: Introduce a rating and feedback system to promote trust between freelancers and clients and help others make informed decisions.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, freelancers can log their work hours, and clients can pay for those hours through the smart contract functions.
